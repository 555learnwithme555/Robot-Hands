# Overview

OpenBionics is an initiative for the development of:
* open source
* affordable
* light-weight
* modular

robot hands and myoelectric prosthetic devices, that can be easily reproduced using off-the-shelf materials.

This repository contains all the necessary files, to replicate our robot hands

We have published a complete tutorial for the replication of our hands. The tutorial can be found [here.](http://www.openbionics.org/TR2015_OpenBionics_RobotHandsGuide.pdf)
