# Robot Hands Interfaces
In order to control robot hands the user can use the proposed interfaces.
#####Robot Hand Extension: 
This interface had two buttons, one for closing and one for opening the robot hand.

#####SliderBox:
This interface had two linear potentiometers. Until now the one of these are active.
Also, SliderBox could be use for robot hands which had two servo motors like
[Model T42  of Yale OpenHand Project](http://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/model_t42.html#performance).

For both interfaces you can find the software, firmware and electronics in respective folders of Robot-Hands repo.
